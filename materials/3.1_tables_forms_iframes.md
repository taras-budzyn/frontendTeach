# Practice work for HTML tables, forms and iframes

Using the basic html5 page that you created at first practice work improve it to look similar like this screenshot.
You should get folder images without changes and use it to do this work.

Also please stick few rules/requirements:

1. Do not use HTML5 deprecated attributes or elements
2. You can use any video to insert into iframe
3. You should not be available to open iframe content to fullsize page width
4. There are one exception, for better understanding table concepts it's better to use border attribute. But it's deprecated at html5, it should be set via CSS. We are not review CSS for now, so for this practice use deprecated ```border``` attribute for table
5. Set form to process with current page and send GET request
