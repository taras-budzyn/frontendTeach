# Practice work for CSS block indents

This practice includes two small works; 

1. Grab the html from the 3.1 practice work and stylize the table border with CSS (the way how you connect CSS to HTML doesn't matter)
  - make border 3px with red color
  - you should see that table have some spacing between the cells. It's not very usefull for our representation. Find a way to remove this space between the cells using CSS. You should have this example at the end

2. Using margin, border and width/height property try to achieve that effect with connected CSS file
